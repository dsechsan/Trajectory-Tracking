# UCSD ECE276B PR3 

## Overview
In this assignment, two different controllers were implemented to make a ground differential-drive robot track a lissajous trajectory safely while avoiding obstacles in the way. More details can be found in the ECE276B_PR3.pdf file. 
## Starter code
### 1. main.py
This file contains examples of how to generate control inputs from a simple P controller and apply the control on a car model.The task is to replace the P controller with our own controller using CEC and GPI as described in the project. This file contains the CEC implementation.
